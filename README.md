# Machine-Learning-Project

The objective of this project is to predict whether upcoming Bollywood movies will be hits or flops based on various features using a machine learning model. By analysing historical data, including features such as budget, cast, director, and genre, the model aims to classify movies into two categories: "Hit" (0) or "Flop" (1). The project uses supervised learning techniques to train a model on labelled data and then evaluates its performance on unseen test data.
